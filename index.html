 Q // But what is Communication?
    <br><br>
</h2> 
<h3>
    Communication is the process of which multiple people come  <br>together to share thoughts and ideas.  <br>Effective communication entails the proper exchange  <br>of ideas without any barriers and confusion.
</h3>
<br><br>
<h2>
Q // and do we believe that Trinity College east has Effective Communication?

</h2>
<br><br>
<h3>
    Yes, we believe that TCE (as a school) has effective communication.

Student’s can use Microsoft teams to message <br> their teachers when they’re not in school.<br><br>

Teachers or students can come together to create a whatsapp<br> group to make communication easier among themselves.<br><br>

Teachers are usually in staffrooms where teacher can be visited<br>
 by students during their breaks to get work they may have missed <br>
 or to hand in assignment that they haven’t submitted
 <br><br>
The Public Announcement system, <br>
as well as the monitor that are on the Block<br>
 and in the main Building, help to communicate the same message<br>
  to every student and teacher simultaneously.

<h2>Q // and what can hinder communication between the various member?</h2>
<h3><br><br>
    Some factors that can affect communication in TCE are age , gender and racism.

Q // Are there any barriers to communication at TCE?
</h2>
<h3>
     We do not believe that there are any barriers of communication at TCE. </h3><br><br>

            Q //  well, how can we fix these issues?

                    Personalized Communication is more than just writing out a message is sending it out.<br> 
                    It involves infusing the voice with the audience. <br>
                    Personalizing Communication will help Parents <br>
                    and the school identify problem early on. <br>
                    Personalized praises will motivate student to do better.<br>
                     We were told by the principal that the school pays 750,000 Dollars yearly for PowerSchool. <br>
                     The school could inform the parents of importance of using PowerSchool to help bridge the gap between home and school. 
                     <br><br>

                    Allocation of budget towards communication training – <br>
                    If parents don’t start using PowerSchool the school <br>
                    can just stop paying for it and allocate the money towards communication<br>
                     training. With better communication this will help students inform <br>
                     teacher of their problems this will also help teachers to communicate <br>
                     better with their students.  <br><br>
                    
                    Building relationships – Strong relationships between students 
                    <br>and teachers may enhance students’ motivation and improve learning abilities.<br>
                     Way to improve relationships are by teaching students in small groups<br>
                      having social activities around student’s goals. Some ways to build <br>
                      strong relationships with students are to make genuine attempts to get to know them.<br>
                       You could spend time asking about their plans. What they did over the weekend and <br>
                       encourage students to open. You can also discuss recent popular entertainment or trends. 
                       <br><br>
                    
                    Newsletters – Newsletters are letters send to stakeholders of the school to inform<br>
                     them of activities going on in the school. A newsletter is a valuable tool in communication<br>
                      to large groups. It will help to keep all stakeholders aware of what’s going on in the school.

                <h2>
        Q // What do you think would be the best form of communication for TCE to adopt?
    </h2>
    <h3>
        The best channel of communication i would recommend  <br>
        for TCE is face to face because Face-to-face communication<br>
         is often more effective than written or audio-only conversations.<br>
          This is because seeing one another allows<br>
           us to pick up on nonverbal cues and body language
    </h3> // Example( school rather face to <br>
        face to insure students<br> 
        are paying attention in class , <br>
        they would be able to read there body <br>
        language and it can also benefits the teacher<br>
         when it’s comes to participation in a class )
    <h3>
    PROS :<br> In-person interaction allows for the observation of facial expressions, body language, <br>
    and gestures, providing additional layers of meaning and context to the conversation and Fast Feedback: <br>
    Real-time response to verbal and non-verbal cues allows for instant clarification and understanding during the conversation.<br><br>
    CONS :<br>In-person
    meetings often require travel time, scheduling coordination, and may<br>
    take longer than virtual communication methods and<br> Face-to-
    face communication is limited to individuals <br>who are physically present in the same location, <br>making it impractical for remote or
    distributed teams.
